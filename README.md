## Workflow

### 1. Data collection & processing

#### 1.1 Data availability

The publicly available raw sequencing data from CRC studies were used in this analysis and are available on the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI.

“the data for this study have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under accession number PRJEBxxxx (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB27928).”

>Note: The list of all studies including metadata was retrieved and modified from [Wirbel _et al.,_ 2021](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02306-1). The metadata from Gupta _et al.,_ 2019 and Yamada _et al.,_ 2019 were seperately obtained according to the information provided by the researchers in their papers.

#### 1.2 Raw data pre-processing


#### 1.3 Functional profiling
Functional profiles of high-quality metagenomic shotgun sequences were determined using [HUMAnN 3.0](https://github.com/biobakery/humann) [(Francesco _et al.,_ 2020)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/65088).

```bash
bash humann.sh
```

#### 1.4 Taxonomic profiling

Taxonomic profiles


### 2. Metadata and feature table preparation

#### 2.1 Metadata

The metadata was retrieved and modified from [Wirbel _et al.,_ 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-019-0406-6). The metadata from Gupta _et al.,_ 2019 and Yamada _et al.,_ 2019 were seperately obtained according to the information provided by the researchers in their papers.

The final metadata used in this project can be found in [CRC_MasterThesis/data/meta](https://github.com/ErikaDva/CRC_MasterThesis/blob/main/scripts/test) folder as `"meta.crc.tsv"`.

**or**  

can be generated by running the script:  
[`2.1_prepare_metadata.R`](https://github.com/ErikaDva/CRC_MasterThesis/blob/main/scripts/test)

#### 2.2 Feature tables

The feature tables produced by [HUMAnN 3.0](https://github.com/biobakery/humann) were subjected to post-processing in R Studio.

Firstly, multi-sequenced samples were merged together taking into the account the library sizes using these scripts:  
[`2.2_prepare_functional_data.R`](https://github.com/ErikaDva/CRC_MasterThesis/blob/main/scripts/test)\
[`2.2_prepare_pathway_data.R`](https://github.com/ErikaDva/CRC_MasterThesis/blob/main/scripts/test)\
[`2.2_prepare_gene_data.R`](https://github.com/ErikaDva/CRC_MasterThesis/blob/main/scripts/test)\
[`2.2_prepare_taxonomic_data.R`](https://github.com/ErikaDva/CRC_MasterThesis/blob/main/scripts/test)

>Note: exception with CN-CRC study as the numbner of samples matches the metadata entries

Secondly, the feature tables were cleaned and filtered to remove low-abundant features:  
[`2.2_clean_functional_data.R`](https://github.com/ErikaDva/CRC_MasterThesis/blob/main/scripts/test)\
[`2.2_clean_pathway_data.R`](https://github.com/ErikaDva/CRC_MasterThesis/blob/main/scripts/test)\
[`2.2_clean_taxonomic_data.R`](https://github.com/ErikaDva/CRC_MasterThesis/blob/main/scripts/test)

### 3. Explorative analysis (ampvis2)

R package, [ampvis2](https://madsalbertsen.github.io/ampvis2/index.html), was utilised for explorative analysis of functional and taxonomic feature tables. The package was originally developed for visualing amplicon data, however, it is capable of dealing with shotgun metagenomics data.

### 4. Association testing

#### 4.1 SIAMCAT/Wirbel

#### 4.2 MaAsLin2

R package, [MaAslin2](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/maaslin/), was used to determine multivariable associations between metadata and microbial features [(Mallick _et al.,_ 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02306-1). It is based on general linear models.

### 5. Machine learning models

Machine learning models were built using [SIAMCAT](https://siamcat.embl.de/) pipeline for associations between gut microbiome and host phenotype [(Wirbel _et al.,_ 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02306-1).

#### 5.1 LASSO

#### 5.2 Random Forest

### Set-up & Data preparation

1. import_feat_suffix()
2. remove_name_and_export()
3.
